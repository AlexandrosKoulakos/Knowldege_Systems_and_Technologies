# Knowldege_Systems_and_Technologies

This repository hosts the lab exercices of the course Knowledge Systems and Technologies, 8th semster, ECE NTUA. 

- In the first exercice, we construct a fully functional knowledge graph based on a given csv containing data about songs and their corresponding composers, titles, musical instruments that are employed, feelings they generate, genres they belong to etc. We perform SPARQL queries to our graph to check its validation and consistency and finally we combine those queries to propose a song recommender.

- In the second exercice, we expand our knowledge graph from Lab1 into a fully functional and consistent ontology (we tranasform our data into concepts, roles and individuals). We further expand our ontology by stating rules and axioms that hold for instances of specified concepts. These axioms are applied to the corresponding concepts using the reasoner via Protégé. Finally, we use GraphDB in order to visualise the expanded ontology and to perform SPARQL queries that showcase its validity and enrichment.
